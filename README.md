# Magento Cronjob Manager [Abandoned]

I'm no longer supporting this module :( 

But, you can checkout my [Cron Job Manager for Magento 2](https://github.com/Ethan3600/magento2-CronjobManager)!!!

------

Simple. Easy. Free. Magento Cron Job Manager

Works with Magento 1.9.2.4, 1.9.3.1

> Hasn't been tested on older versions

----

__This module can:__

* **Dispatch** (more than once) magento cron jobs (as long as they're scheduled)

* **View** scheduled magento cron jobs

* **Schedule** new magento cron jobs

* **Delete** scheduled magento cron jobs

* **Update** scheduled magento cron jobs

* **Flush** out old magento cron jobs


## Why this instead of AOE Scheduler?

AOE Scheduler definitely has a lot more bells and whistles to it and it's a great piece of software!

But this module is able mitigate all the major problems that AOE Scheduler solved with half the amount of code (probably less).
This module is a lot "lighter" in comparison, and it doesn't need any installation scripts. So, no database manipulation upon installation (unlike AOE Scheduler).

Also, I personally think this is the most intuitive way to handle Cron jobs from the backend UI.

> P.s. I had no intention of rivaling another extention. I just wanted to make something and share it =)
